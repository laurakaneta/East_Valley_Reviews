Eastern University Capstone Project

I recently moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and I only know a handful of the local places. Close to where I live, there is an area known as the East Valley. It is a thriving area located in the eastern portion of Maricopa County. The main cities in this region include Gilbert, Chandler, Mesa, and Tempe. This area is popular for its vast array of restaurant options. Because of this, I created a content-based recommender system hosted in a cloud-based application that allows users to select a restaurant that they enjoy in the area and receive back a recommended establishment that is similar to the one selected. This application is accessible on oneâ€™s phone and will only recommend local places to eat in the East Valley. This recommender system was constructed using unstructured written reviews from the top food establishments in each city.
